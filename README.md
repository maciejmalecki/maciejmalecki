### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

There are plenty of stuff you can find in my repos:

* I do some MOS 6502 Assembly coding here: [trex64](https://github.com/maciejmalecki/trex64), [bluevessel](https://github.com/maciejmalecki/bluevessel); but vast majority of my work can be found in [c64lib](https://github.com/c64lib) organization.
* The T-Rex64 game has its own webpage: https://maciejmalecki.github.io/trex64/.
* There's also a gradle [plugin](https://github.com/c64lib/gradle-retro-assembler-plugin) supporting Assembly coding with [Kick Assembler](http://theweb.dk/KickAssembler). There is an online [manual](https://c64lib.github.io/gradle-retro-assembler-plugin/) as well.
* There are some slidedecks from presentations I made.
* I also do some IoT devices based on ESP 8266 such as [weather](https://github.com/maciejmalecki/weather) or [ESP 8266 programmer](https://github.com/maciejmalecki/esp8266-programmer).

There is also this very lame and not-that-frequently-updated [blog](https://maciejmalecki.github.io/blog/).
